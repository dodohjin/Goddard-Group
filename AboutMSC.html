            <p>The overarching goal of our research has been to develop theoretical methods sufficiently accurate that the need for experimental validation can be severely restricted to the predicted best systems and sufficiently efficient that they can be applied to realistic models with millions of atoms. Starting in ~ 1970, my vision is what was in the 2000s labeled Materials Genomics but differs from the current view in that I prioritized developing a mechanistic understanding of the reactions at the atomic level and then using the mechanism to guide the search for improved materials. At the QM level, this required developing an unbiased orbital-based description of the valence bond interactions (GVB) and improving the description of London dispersion (van der Waals attraction) and band gaps for materials applications.
            </p>
            <p>To describe reactions at the macroscale, we developed improved QM-derived reactive force fields (ReaxFF and later RexPoN) that enabled reactive dynamics that retain near-first-principles accuracy, and we developed rule-based force approaches to the entire periodic table (UFF), so we did not have to wait on the QM.
            </p>
            <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, my group developed the mathematical methods to enable quantum mechanics (QM) predictions (GVB) of reactions and catalysis, and we applied these methods to understand the principles of chemical bonding (following in the footsteps of Pauling but based on fundamental QM principles) and using these concepts to explain the mechanisms of reactions and laser to homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.</p>
          
            <p>By the 1980s our focus changed to
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiscale multiparadigm methods based on QM to enable predictions on materials, chemical, and biochemical systems involving millions of atoms (a 25 nm cube typically has millions of atoms) at time scales of 100â€™s of nanoseconds while retaining the accuracy of QM.</li>
                    <li>And simultaneously applying these methods to predict and optimize the structures and properties of complex chemical, catalytic, materials, and biochemical materials in advance of experimental synthesis and characterization, later referred to as materials genomics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The applications in the 1970s were mostly to reaction mechanisms and catalysis, which continued by the 2000s to detailed reaction mechanisms underlying complex heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. In addition, in the 1970s we had a major focus on the surface science for which the experimental techniques were just emerging. Here the emphasis was on reconstruction of semiconductors and adsorption of atoms on metal surfaces.
            </p>
            <p>By the 1990s, our work extended to nanotechnology and amorphous condensed solids (polymers, metals), which expanded to proteins, DNA, superconductivity in the 2000s and more recently electrocatalysis and membrane proteins. 
            </p>
            <p>In 1990, I established the Materials and Process Simulation Center in the Beckman Institute at Caltech with the specific purpose of developing and applying new methods to provide practical predictions on materials, catalysis, and pharma problems and to help theory groups in industry use these methods on their problems.</p>
            <p>This involved about 50 companies over the years with projects at the level of 1 to 4 postdocs running from 3 to 21 years. This activity contributed to such areas as scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, and wax formation inhibitors for upstream petroleum applications, wear inhibitors and wear resistance films for automobile applications, to structures of membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for pharma (prior to publication of experimental X-ray structures that started in 2005).</p>
            <p>Often our studies were the first applications of atomistic theory to these problems.
            </p>
            <p>Our successes were partly based on outstanding chemical intuition but mostly to extremely smart grad students and postdocs.
