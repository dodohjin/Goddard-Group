 Using html, css, and JS. 
 
 I started with the basic structure(basic.html) which has same header and footer so that I can only change the middle part depend on the content. 
 
 (It causes me to think that I have to learn ReactJS so badly.)
 
 I've practiced so much how to deal with different data type such as array & object by using huge json database related to his over 1500 papers. 
 
 I've also practiced how to make from excel to json, and web scraping. 
 
 Homework: I think I need to figure out how to reload json directly from excel on the web.
 
 Now, someone has to execute the js file to make new json file from the excel. (excel -> (js) -> json -> (js) -> html) 
 
 But I want to reload automatically whenver there is modification on the excel file, JS will grab those changes and send to html.
