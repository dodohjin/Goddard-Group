The x and y axes represent the positions of the CBPQT<sup>4+/2(+•)</sup> rings on the loop.

In State I, [CBPQT-A]<sup>4+</sup> and [CBPQT-B]<sup>4+</sup> are positioned around the T and BPM units, respectively. Reduction of the V<sup>2+</sup> units and the CBPQT<sup>4+</sup> rings by injections (Step 1) of six electrons in total triggers both rings to undergo a clockwise rotation, leading to the formation (State II) of the reduced state [3]CMM<sup>7+6•</sup>. Subsequent oxidation by the removal (Step 2) of six electrons restores the Coulombic repulsion between the two rings and the loop, obliging [CBPQT-B]<sup>4+</sup> to thread over (State III) the steric barrier (IPP) under thermal activation and eventually encircle T, while [CBPQT-A]<sup>4+</sup> finds itself threaded around BPM, thus completing a 180˚ positional exchange between the two rings shown in State I′. A second redox cycle (Step 3 and 4) resets the system back to State I after the accomplishment of another 180˚ positional exchange between the two rings. </p>

                        <p>As Stoddart was designing and synthesizing new mechanically bonded supramolecular moieties for use in designing nano machines, nano shuttles, inclusion complexes, artificial molecular muscles, nano receptor boxes, light-driven movements of nano assemblies, etc., our group was right with them in the trenches calculating various structures, interactions and dynamics, spectroscopic signatures and so on, to help us validate the structures and properties of our nano machine technology. (See: [#554, #623. #767, #783, #800, #819, #833, #968, #1031, #1040, #1061]) Stoddart told me that he considered that our efforts were indispensable to the progress of his experimental program.

                        <p>A very important contribution of our theory was [#1160]. Another theory group had carried out low-level DFT calculations (not hybrid, no solvent) and claimed on this basis that the 1:1 inclusion complex of CBPQT [cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene)]with TTF (tetrathiafulvalene), on which Stoddart had published numerous experimental and theory papers, was incorrect. The other group claimed that the molecular components were complexed one with another but not an inclusion compound. Wei-Guang Liu jumped quickly onto this issue (along with Stoddart) and carried out a number of DFT calculations (hybrid and not) and under relevant solvent conditions. For each case, we calculated the complexation energetics and spectroscopic signatures. The resulting paper [#1160] established quite convincingly that the 1:1 inclusion complex is in fact the correct molecular structure. This removed a cloud of suspicion from Stoddart’s research program.

                        <p>An area where our understanding of chemical bonding became quite important was Stoddart’s creation and characterization of stable molecular tetraradical and triradical systems. (See: [#834, #910, #991, #1010, #1062, #1093, #1161, #1181]) 
                            These unique structures are stabilized by mechanical bonding, leading to multiradical molecules in configurations where the radicals are prevented from bonding strongly. Such broken bond systems, however, are described very poorly with DFT theory alone. 
                            Here, we used our understanding of bonding to use DFT on the one structure for which DFT is valid (high spin, thus S=2 for the tetraradical). We then used this wavefunction to initialize ab initio CAS-SCF (same as GVB-CI) calculations to optimize the two singlet,
                             three triplet, and quintet states for the tetraradical, leading to rigorous spin couplings. For these structures, we showed how the bonding was modified as the tetraradical was oxidized and reduced through nine distinct redox states. Further, we calculated the 
                             eight redox potentials – of which Stoddart was able to measure six in the laboratory – which proved to be in good agreement with his experimental results. This complex is <b>the first stable tetraradical molecular species</b>, demonstrating how the bonding between the 
                             four radicals depends on the redox state.
